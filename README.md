Calculator
==========

WHAT IS IT?
This is an implementation of a calculator, in two methods, each with their own self-sufficient class. 
The first, called PostFix calc, first converts the expression given to it to PostFix format and then solves it. 
The second, called RecursiveCalc, uses recursion to solve the given expression. 

NOTES: 
It hasn't yet been configured for error- handling.
